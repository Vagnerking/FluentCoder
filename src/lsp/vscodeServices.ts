/**
 * Boots the `@codingame/monaco-vscode-api` services exactly ONCE for the whole
 * app, then hands every later caller the same in-flight promise.
 *
 * ──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 * WHY THIS REPLACES `MonacoServices.install(monaco)`
 * ──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 * In monaco-languageclient v1.x, `MonacoServices.install(monaco)` taught the
 * language client how to talk to a plain `monaco-editor` distribution. That API
 * is GONE in v10. Instead the client expects a subset of the REAL VS Code
 * services to be running, supplied by `@codingame/monaco-vscode-api`. We boot
 * just enough of them through the low-level `initialize(overrides)` entry point
 * (the pattern proven by spike #70 — see ADR 0003).
 *
 * Both `src/monaco-loader.ts` (app entry, before the first editor mounts) and
 * `src/lsp/client.ts` (before creating any language client) await this. It is
 * idempotent: the FIRST call starts `initialize()`; concurrent and later calls
 * share the same promise. Calling `initialize()` twice throws ("already
 * initialized"), so funnelling through here is mandatory.
 *
 * ──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 * SERVICE-OVERRIDE SET
 * ──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 * `initialize()` ALWAYS boots a base set on its own (layout, environment,
 * extension, files, quickAccess). On top of that we pass the minimal explicit
 * set a `MonacoLanguageClient` needs to bridge LSP <-> editor models:
 *
 *   - languages       registers language ids + the provider registries the
 *                     client's features (completion, hover, references,
 *                     semantic tokens, …) attach to.
 *   - log             the client + services emit through the VS Code logger.
 *   - model           text-model / resolver service: maps `file://` URIs to
 *                     ITextModel so didOpen/didChange have something to track.
 *   - configuration   settings store the client reads (per-language options).
 *
 * We deliberately STOP there — no editor/views/theme/textmate service
 * overrides. Rationale (audit §2, risk matrix):
 *   - The editor itself is still mounted by `@monaco-editor/react` as a
 *     STANDALONE editor (ADR 0003 keeps it via the `monaco-editor` alias). The
 *     workbench `editor-service-override` would compete with that and with our
 *     own `registerEditorOpener` (cross-file go-to-definition). Headless model
 *     services are all the LSP round-trip needs; the standalone editor brings
 *     its own theming (`defineTheme`) and Monarch tokenizer registration.
 *   - Semantic theming stays on the STANDALONE theme path (`defineTheme` +
 *     `'semanticHighlighting.enabled': true`), which works without the VS Code
 *     theme/textmate services. Pulling those in would replace the standalone
 *     theme engine and silently drop our `fluent-acrylic-dark` rules.
 *
 * No `container` argument → headless services (no workbench DOM mounted), which
 * is exactly right when the editor is a standalone `@monaco-editor/react` view.
